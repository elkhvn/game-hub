# React Security Learning App

This repository contains a web application written in React. It was created by a security engineer to understand the logic behind React and to improve skills in React security code reviews.

## Description

This project serves as a learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of React, as well as best practices in securing React applications. It leverages modern tools and libraries to create a responsive and robust web application.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite.js**: A fast build tool for modern web projects.
- **React Library**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular, and accessible component library for React.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elkhvn/game-hub cd game-hub
    ```
    
2. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:


```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application and open it in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:


```bash
npm run build
```


The production-ready files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Features

- **Modern UI**: Built using Chakra UI for a responsive and accessible design.
- **API Integration**: Uses Axios for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **Fast Development**: Utilizes Vite.js for instant server start and fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the core concepts of React, including components, state, and props.
- Explore the integration of third-party libraries like Chakra UI and Axios.
- Gain insights into best practices for securing React applications.
- Improve skills in reviewing React code for security vulnerabilities.
